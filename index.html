							PureScript is a typed, pure, functional programming language.
							It's inspired by Haskell, so if you're familiar with Haskell, or
							Elm it will look familiar.

						Types can be inferred by the compiler
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							In PureScript, types are known at compile time. The developer can
							include type signatures, but isn't required to because the
							compiler can infer them. However, in practice they are almost never omitted.
						</p>

					<h2>Pure</h2>
					<p class="fragment">
						inputs -> outputs
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						No side-effects
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Pure functions map inputs to outputs and no matter how many
							times you call a function with the same input you'll get the same
							output.
						</p>
						<p>
							Pure functions are referentially transparent, which means you can
							replace the functional call with it's return value and there is
							no change to your program.
						</p>
						<p>
							Pure functions can't have side effects. No logging to the console,
							no HTTP requests, and no DOM. These functions are not referentially
							transparent.

					<h2>Effects As Data</h2>
					<pre class="fragment">
						<code class="haskell">
Eff (Effect) Result
						</code>
					</pre>
					<pre class="fragment">
						<code class="haskell">
f :: Eff (dom :: DOM) Location

g :: Eff (now :: NOW) Instant

h :: UserId -> Aff (ajax :: AJAX) User
						</code class="haskell">
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							So what good is a language that is made up of functions that can't
							do anything? I mean, eventually you're going to want to render
							something to the DOM, or get some data from a server, right?
						</p>
						<p>
							In pure languages, side-effects are encoded into types. PureScript
							uses the Eff type to wrap up all of the effects our program has.
						</p>
						<p>
							The type tells you the type of effect and the type of result
						</p>
						<p>
							Here are a few examples.
						</p>
						<p>
							Don't worry if this code makes no sense right now, what's
							important is that in PureScript we can look at the type and know
							whether or not it creates a side effect. What's more, we can know,
							just from the type, exactly what type of effect it is.
						</p>
					</aside>

				<section data-background="images/san-fran.jpg">
				<h2>Functional</h2>
					<p>
						Literally just programming with functions.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							A lot of time and effort has gone in to giving functional programming
							very involved definitions, but that's really all it is.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can program with functions in a lot of languages; JavaScript,
							Ruby, Scala, but they also allow you to program in other styles.
							PureScript, on the other hand, does not.

					<h3>Functions</h3>
					<pre class="fragment">
						<code class="haskell">
add :: Number -> Number -> Number
add x y = x + y
						</code>
					</pre>
					<pre class="fragment">
						<code class="haskell">
add 10 11
						</code>
					</pre>
					<pre class="fragment">
						<code class="haskell">
arrayMap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
arrayMap = map
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							This is how a function is defined in PureScript. The first line
							is the type. It says "the function add takes two numbers and returns
							another number". The "::" separates the name from the type. The parameters
							are separated by "->" and the last item in the type is the return type.
						</p>
						<p>
							Functions can also be polymorphic. The type of "arrayMap" says it takes
							a function from some type "a" to some type "b" and a list of "a's",
							and it will return a list of "b's". "a" and "b" are type variables.
							So this function works with any "a" and any "b", and it's important to
							note that "a" and "b" don't have to be different, but they can be.

					<h2>Algebraic Data Types</h2>
					<pre class="fragment">
						<code class="haskell">
data RGB = Red | Green | Blue
						</code>
					</pre>
					<pre class="fragment">
						<code class="haskell">
data Action = AddUser User | UpdateName String
						</code>
					</pre>
					<pre class="fragment">
						<code class="haskell">
data User = User String Number
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Algebraic Data Types is the name given to a set containing two
							kinds of data types: Sum Types and Product Types. In each instance
							there is an "algebra" for figuring out the number of possible
							values a type can hold. For Sum types we can calculate it using
							addition, and from Product types we use multiplication.
						</p>
						<p>
							First we'll take a look at sum types, also called union types, if
							you're familiar with enums in other languages this should look
							pretty familiar. We've got a type "RGB" and there are three possible
							values from that type: "Red", "Green" and "Blue".
						</p>
						<p>
							This next example shows creates and "Action" type, with two possible
							values: "AddUser" or "UpdateName", but each of these comes with some
							extra information. "AddUser" comes with a "User" and "UpdateName"
							inlcudes a "Name".
						</p>
						<p>
							In this final example, we have a data type for a "User" and in order
							to have a "User" it must have a "String" and a "Number". What those
							types correspond to we don't know. Could be the name and age, could
							be nonsense.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/wedding.jpg">
					<h2>Records</h2>
					<pre>
						<code class="haskell">
type User =
  { name :: String
  , age :: Number
  }
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Records are like object literals in JavaScript; just simple
							key/value pairs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here we are using a type alias to define a record type. We're not
							introducing a new data type, we're just saying, "We're going to call
							a record that has a 'name' that is a String and an age that is a
							Number, a User".
						</p>
						<p>
							An important note with aliases is that they only provide a new way
							to talk about existing types. If I create an alias for String and
							call it Name, it's still just a string. Functions that take a Name
							as an argument can still be called with any String.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/wedding.jpg">
					<h2>Newtype</h2>
					<pre>
						<code class="haskell">
newtype Name = Name String

newtype Age = Age Number

newtype User = User { name :: Name
                    , age :: Age
                    }
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							A newtype is a way to wrap up an existing type. The type "Name String"
							is not a string; unlike aliases which only give us a new way to
							talk about existing types, newtypes give us compile time benefits.
						</p>
						<p>
							The nice thing about newtypes is that there is no overhead for
							declaring one; the runtime representation is exactly the same as the
							underlying type.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the huge benefits of newtypes is they allow us to write new
							typeclass instances for existing types. We'll touch on typeclasses
							in a moment, but what this means is that the type "Name String",
							while ultimately still a string can have different behavior than
							a normal string; for example, in how we compare for equality.

					<h2>Pattern Matching</h2>
					<pre class="fragment">
						<code class="haskell">
royGeeBiv :: RGB -> String
royGeeBiv R = "Roy"
royGeeBiv G = "Gee"
royGeeBiv B = "Biv"
						</code>
					</pre>
					<pre class="fragment">
						<code class="haskell">
data UserAccount =
    Guest
  | Authenticated { name :: String }

greetUser :: UserAccount -> String
greetUser Guest = "Wanna create an account"
greetUser (Authenticated { name }) = "Welcome back " <> name
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Pattern matching allows us to write function definitions based
							on the value of the input. It's very similar to a "switch" block.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this first example we match on the literal value "1" and return
							true. For all other numbers, the underscore there is a catchall,
							we return false.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the next example, we provide a definition for every possible
							value of our "RGB" type and return a string represention
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, we create a UserAccount type that is either a Guest,
							which has no additional data, or an Autheticated user with a name.
							We provide a definition for each and in the the Authenticated
							case we pull the name out and append it to the "Welcome back "
							message.
						</p>
						<p>
							Pattern matches must be exhaustive, or your function must be
							explicitly marked as Partial, meaning it doesn't handle all inputs.
							You can exhaust all patterns either by handling each possible
							input or by using a catchall.

					<h2>Fancy Types</h2>

						<p>
							If you're familiar with Elm, you might have heard the term
							'fancy types' used to describe some of the types in languages like
							Haskell or PureScript. Things like Monoid, Functor and Monad. Most
							of the time what people are talking about are typeclasses; which
							Elm doesn't have.
						</p>
						<p>
							A typeclass is just a way to abstract out common functionality. If
							you're familiar with interfaces in C# or Java, or templates in C++,
							it's the same idea.
						</p>
						<p>
							The reason they have a reputation for being "fancy" or "scary", in
							my opinion, is because things like Functor or Monad are more abstract
							that what most of use are used to.
						</p>
						<p>
							The "Eq" typeclass, for example, is much more concrete. It lets us
							define how equality works for our types.

						<p>
							The Elm architecture is a simple pattern for architecting webapps.
							It is great for modularity, code reuse, and testing.
						</p>
						<p>
							The pattern breaks modules into three pieces. The "State", which
							represents the state of your application or component*. An "Update"
							function which transforms your state based on "Action"s. And a "View"
							function that renders the "State".
						</p>
						<p>
							Users of Redux may recognize this pattern as it was the inspiration
							for the library.

					<h2>An Example</h2>

				<section data-background="images/doubletree-2.jpg">
					<pre>
						<code class="haskell">
data Action = Increment | Decrement

type State = Int

init :: State
init = 0
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							We're going to take a look at a basic counter app. You press a
							plus button and the count goes up. Press and minus button and it
							goes down.
						</p>
						<p>
							We start by defining the actions a user can take; Increment or Decrement.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/doubletree-2.jpg">
					<pre>
						<code class="haskell">
update :: Action -> State -> State
update Increment state = state + 1
update Decrement state = state - 1
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Next comes our State, and in this case we just going to use an Int,
							but we've given it an alias to make things easier to follow. We also
							give an initial state for our counter.
						</p>
						<p>
							Next is the Update function which takes an Action, the current,
							and returns the new state. We pattern match on each type of Action
							and either increment or decrement the counter.
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally we have the View function which takes the current State
							and returns some Html that can perform the types of Actions we
							described above.
						</p>
						<p>
							Pux provides a DSL for constructing HTML. Each element type has a
							a corresponding function. Each element function takes two arguments,
							a list of attributes, and a list of children.
						</p>
						<p>
							So we have an H1, an increment button, a span that shows the count,
							and a decrement button. When the user clicks a button our Update
							function is called with the correct action, and state. Then the View
							function is called to render the new state.

					<h2>Why</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							So why would you want to program like this? Programming with pure
							functions, immutable data, and types puts a lot of restriction on
							the developer, what's the benefit? For me the benefit is in
							reliability, reasoning, and testing.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/windows.jpg">
					<h3>
						Testing
					</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							When a function just maps inputs to outputs and can have no side
							effects, the testing is far simpler. Additionally, adding types
							can completely eliminate entire classes of test.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/windows.jpg">
					<h3>
						Reliability
					</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							A common saying in Haskell/PureScript/Elm languages is, "If it
							compiles, it works." This is mostly a joke, but there putting
							these constraints on your code greatly improves correctness leading
							to fewer Bugs. Richard Feldman of No Red Ink, the largest
							production user of Elm, is fond of saying that their Elm code has
							had zero runtime errors in over a year.

					<h3>
						Reasoning
					</h3>
					<pre class="fragment">
						<code class="haskell">
update :: Action -> State -> State
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							What can you tell me about what this function does? It could do a
							lot things really. We don't really know what it does, but we
							absolutely know what it doesn't do: It doesn't use anything other
							than some "Action" & "State", and it cannot have any effects; No
							logging, no HTTP requests, no DOM.
						</p>
						<p>
							But types can tell us a fair bit about what a function actually
							does. That has to do with parametricity & Free Thereoms, but those
							topics are beyond the scope of this talk.
						</p>
						<p>
							We know these things because our functions are pure and side-effects
							are encoded in types. Without these constraints, we lose the ability
							to reason about our programs in this way.
